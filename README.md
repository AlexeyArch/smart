Pure Go SMART Library
=====================

This is a pure Go implementation of SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and
Reporting Technology), the monitoring system included in most HDDs and SSDs.

This project is a work in progress, in the early stages of development. The API
is highly likely to change during development.

A simple example of how to use the library is included in the `smartctl`
directory.
